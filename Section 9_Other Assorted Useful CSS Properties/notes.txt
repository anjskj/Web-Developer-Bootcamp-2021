    - relative: relative position within its parent-container when using top, bottom, left and right wihtout affecting other elements.
    - absolute: relative to the body (or to its positioned parent if it is nested within another positioned element).
    - fixed: element will stay in the same spot even when scrolling the page, relative to the body, used for nav-bars.
    - sticky: similar to fixed but will start with scrolling along with its ccontainer until it hits the top of the page and then it will become fixed.
* Transition-property: set on the original CSS style and not the pseudo-class styling, commonly used with :hover.
    - shorthand {transition: property to animate duration/timing-function/delay;} separated with space. 
* Transform-property: set on the pseudo-class if used with for example :hover.
    - {transform-origin: bottom-right;} - setting rotation axis.
    - shorthand {transform: rotate(45deg) scale(0.5) translate(200px, 200px) skew(15deg, 25deg);}
* Background shorthand: {background: image/position/size;} separated with space OBS if using size syntax needs to be position/size.
