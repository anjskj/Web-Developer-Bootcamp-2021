    - HTTP-request will be sent: action-attribute is where it will be sent and method-attribute is whether we want to get (default) or post data.
    - Each input should have a label and be separated with divs.
    - Input types: the "type"-attribute determines how the input behaves (text, password, color etc.).
    - Label attribute "for" should match the input attribute "id".
    - Buttons inside a form are by default submit.
    - The"name"-attribute on an input refers to the value when the data is sent to the server so it knows what to do with the data sent int he HTTP-request.
    - Radio buttons-attribute "name" should be the same for all buttons to group them, while "id" and "value" are individual (and usually the same).
    - Select and Textera are satndalone elements in form controls.
    - Browser Validations: mainly for guiding the client to insert correct and valid data. "required" - attribute, minlength/maxlength, min/max, "pattern"-attribute (regex) OBS some input-types already have a default pattern, for example email requires an @.
    - Server Validations: mainly for security.
