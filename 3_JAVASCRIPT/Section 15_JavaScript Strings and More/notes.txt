* String: string of characters that represent text
    - let firstName = 'Anja'; (can use both single- & double-quotes.)
    - Indexed starting with the first character in position 0, called with firstName[0] would output "A". 
    - If trying to call on an index that doesn´t exist result will be undefined.
    - concatenation: let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
    - typeof fullName; will output the variabel type.
* String Porperties:
    - variableName.length; outputs the total number of characters.
* String Methods:
    - Can be destructive (changing the value) or non-destructive (not changing the value, needs to be stored in a new variable)
    - variableName.method();
    - .toUpperCase(); non-destructive, makes everything uppercase (.toLowerCase(); also exist)
    - .trim(); non-destructive, removes spaces in beginning and end of string.
    - chaining methods: variableName.toUpperCase().trim();
* String Methods with arguments (check MDN)
    - .indexOf(arg); returns the first occurence of the argument value, if not found output will be -1.
    - .slice(beginIndex[, endIndex]); extracts a portion of a string, outputs a new string, non-destructive.
    - .replace('replace', 'with'); replaces the first instance of the matching instance (.replaceAll(); exist but not fully implemented?)
    - .repeat(count); hoew many times variablevalue should be repeated, non-destructive. 
* String Template Literals:
    - `You bought ${3 + 4} ${product.toUpperCase()}s. Total is $${price * qty}`;
* Null- intentional absence of value, must be assigned. 
    - No one is logged in: let loggedInUSer = null; Anja loggs in: loggedInUser = 'Anja';
* Undefined - unintentional absence of value or are undefined. "I don´t know"
* Math-object: contains properties and methods for maths.
    - properties: Math.prop; .PI
    - methods: Math.method(); .round(num), floor(decimalNum), ceil(decimalNum), .random() gives random number between but not including 0-1.
    - let ranNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
