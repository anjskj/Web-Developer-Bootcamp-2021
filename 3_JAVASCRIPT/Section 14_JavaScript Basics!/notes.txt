* Primtive tyoe variables: number, string, boolean, null, undefined (and symbol, bigint).
* // to comment out a line, /*to comment out several lines*/
* PEMDAS (parenthesis, equation, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction)
* % modulus "remainder operator" 9 % 2: 2 goes into 9 as a whole number 4 times (=8), 1 is the remainder. Usually used to determine if a number is even or odd (evenly divided by 2).
* ** exponent operator  2**4 = 16 (2*2*2*2)
* NaN - considered a number in JS, a value that is not a number, for example 0/0. Not possible to do math with NaN.
* Variables: naming and storing values for later use.
    - syntax: let variableName = value;
    - updating a value: variableName += 1; OR variableName++;
    - const:  constant, a value that cannot be re-assigned/updated
    - let: can be re-assigned/updated
    - var: existed before const and let, DO NOT USE!
* Booleans:
    - value is either true or false.
    - let isAlive = true;
    - often used in logic/decissions
* Identifier naming conventions: camelCase, no spaces or underscores,  never starting with a digit.
